TITLE:: Activity
summary:: model activity level and its subjective decay over time.
categories:: Influx
related:: Classes/Influx, Classes/KtlLoop, etc.

DESCRIPTION::
Activity models the decay of perceived activity level over time. Can be used to track how active some playing interface is being used, and slowly winding down a process if it gets no playing attention.

code::
a = Activity();
a.action = { |a| a.level.round(a.floor).postln }; // post level

	// do this several times to charge up level
a.add(1); 
a.level;
a.dt = 0.1; // slow down model
a.stop;		// stop 
a.play;		// play again
a.action = nil; // stop posting

(
SynthDef(\ting, { |freq, amp|
	Out.ar(0, (SinOsc.ar(freq) * Line.kr(amp, amp * 0.001, 0.2, 5, doneAction: 2)).tanh ! 2);
}).add;

	// more activity creates wider melody jumps,
	// and higher amplitude/distortion
Tdef(\ting, {
	loop {
		if (a.level > 0) {
			(instrument: \ting,
				note: (12 * a.level.rand2.clip2(4)),
				amp: a.level).play;
		};
		0.1.wait;
	}
}).play;
)
// add to activity level while process is playing
a.add(1);
a.add(3);

// set decaytime of model
a.decaytime = 2;

(
var w, mp;
w = Window.new.front;
StaticText(w, w.bounds.moveTo(0,0)).align_(\center)
.string_("click and drag to charge activity level.");
w.view.mouseMoveAction = { |view, x, y|
	var mousepos = (x@y);
	var diff = mousepos - (mp ? mousepos);
	a.add(diff.rho * 0.05);
	mp = mousepos;
	a.level.postln;
};

::


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new

ARGUMENT:: decaytime
time after which level will have decayed by -60dB.

ARGUMENT:: dt
delta time at which model calculation steps happen



INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: skip
a skipjack running the calculation

METHOD:: floor
a minimum value below which energy is set to 0.

METHOD:: decaytime
get and set decaytime, i.e. time after which level has decayed by -60dB.

METHOD:: dt
get and set delta time at which model calculation steps happen.

METHOD:: level
the current activity level

private:: init

METHOD:: play, stop
play or stop skipjack that runs calculation.

METHOD:: add
add a value to current level. When current level is > 1, added level will be scaled down by 1/level.
ARGUMENT:: val
the value to add

METHOD:: action
an action to perform after each calculation step. can be used for debugging, 
or informing related processes about level updates.

METHOD:: decay
next model step: calculate new level based on dt and decaytime.
