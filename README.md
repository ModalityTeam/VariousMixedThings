## VMT -- Various Mixed Things

Useful functions and performance tools.


Currently contains

+ **SFunction** -- a function with an environment within which the function is evaluated
+ **CtlPlayer** -- combination of a NodeProxy and CtLoop with methods to map input controls to parameters (depends on GamePad)
+ **Halo** associate a halo of meanings to an object.
+ **DefLib** make libs where lots of Xdefs can be present in the background, 
(but not in .all, so they dont clutter Xdef.all, resp. mixer)
+ **Influx** controller-reduction made easy (fan-out controls to multiple parameters)
